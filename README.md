# AbsolverMoves
Open Source - Web Deck Builder For Absolver
The purpose is to have an angularjs interface that consumes the nodejs functions to give the functionality of a deck builder.
If you wanna clone the repo and try it locally to see any advancements or try to contribute:

*The absolver moves.sql file contains the tables definitions and all of the data I've currently put on them (whenever I update the db this file will be updated too)

*Node packages used (that require installation) are express and mysql

*I'm bad at tjos readme things idk what else you could need/want to know everything seems pretty straight forward to me.
